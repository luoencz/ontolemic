          Hi! My name is Theo. I'm an AI safety researcher and engineer, located in Tbilisi, Georgia / London, UK. Inner Space is my blog and personal website. I'm a CS major, alumni of such programs as <a href="https://www.arena.education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARENA</a>, <a href="https://espr.camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPR</a>, MIT OCW, <a href="https://bluedot.org/courses/alignment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AISF</a>, and more. I take great interest in anthropology, statistics, mathematics more generally, and philosophy â€” I think a lot about the nature of reality, and how we can understand it from rationalist perspective. Welcome!

      {/* I have been born in 2005, in a small town of Academgorodook, in in 20 something kilometers from Nosovibirsk. When I was only 3, my family moved to Saint Petersburg, where I lived until the february of 2022. There, I studied in a private school and planned to go to university of ITMO. During my high school years, I dabbled in dance, theatre, indie game development, and picked up my life-long passion for TTRPGs and snowboarding. In the meanwhile, I attended Yandex ML program. I also have achieved a 0.03 percentile of the world on EUW server of LoL as a toplaner, and played in a number of tournaments. When I moved to Tbilisi, I applied to university of ISU, where I will have finished my CS bachelor's degree in 2026. In the spring of 2024, I have been hired into Palisade Research. In the summer of 2024, I have attended AISF program. In the fall of 2024, I have attended ARENA and have been accepted to ESPR */}
