          Hi! My name is Theo. I'm an AI safety researcher and engineer, located in Tbilisi, Georgia / London, UK. Inner Space is my blog and personal website. I'm a CS major, alumni of such programs as <a href="https://www.arena.education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARENA</a>, <a href="https://espr.camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPR</a>, MIT OCW, <a href="https://bluedot.org/courses/alignment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AISF</a>, and more. I take great interest in anthropology, statistics, mathematics more generally, and philosophy â€” I think a lot about the nature of reality, and how we can understand it from rationalist perspective. Welcome!

          My current work at <a href="https://palisaderesearch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palisade Research</a> is focused on building capabilitity demonstrations for agentic AI systems. We advise policy makers and other stakeholders on AI safety and alignment. I'm also a part of the APART fellowship, where we most recently have shipped a paper on AI sandbagging problem. I'm open to new opportunities, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:hello.work@xn--the-2na.space">hello.work@xn--the-2na.space</a>.
