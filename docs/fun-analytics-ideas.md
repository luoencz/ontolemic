# Fun Analytics Ideas for Personal Website

## âœ… Implemented

### 1. External Link Tracking
- Tracks which external links visitors click
- Groups by domain for easy analysis
- Captures context (link text) and source page
- Shows most popular external destinations

### 2. Active Session Tracking
- Measures true engagement time (not just tab open time)
- Tracks continuous activity periods with 60-second inactivity threshold
- Records page-level engagement metrics:
  - Time spent per page
  - Scroll depth percentage
  - Interaction counts (clicks, scrolls, keypresses)
- Stores ip_hash as a key for optional location association
- Does not automatically aggregate data - allows flexible analysis

## ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas

### 3. Content Engagement Metrics
- **Copy Events**: Track which code snippets or quotes get copied
- **Gallery Interactions**: Which photos get viewed in lightbox mode
- **Quote Favorites**: Make quotes interactive to track which resonate

### 4. Navigation Patterns
- **Keyboard Usage**: Track % of users who use keyboard navigation
- **Search Analytics**: What terms people search for (without storing personal data)
- **Exit Intent**: Where and when people leave

### 5. Technical Demographics
- **Dark Mode Usage**: If you add theme switching
- **Screen Sizes**: Beyond basic device categories
- **Connection Speed**: Identify slow connections for optimization
- **Browser Features**: Track WebGL, JS versions, etc.

### 6. Interactive Elements
- **Project Demo Time**: How long people spend on Cue or other demos
- **Contact Preferences**: Email vs Telegram click ratio
- **Download Tracking**: Resume, papers, or project files

### 7. Temporal Patterns
- **Active Hours**: When your audience is most active
- **Day of Week Trends**: Weekday vs weekend behavior
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Research interest by time of year
- **Return Visitor Cadence**: How often people come back

### 8. Content Performance
- **Bounce Rates**: By page and referrer
- **Embed Click-through**: Which PageEmbed components attract clicks
- **404 Analysis**: What content people expect but can't find

### 9. Social Proof Metrics
- **Referrer Quality**: Not just source but engagement quality
- **Share Button Usage**: If you add social sharing
- **Citation Tracking**: Monitor if your research gets referenced
- **Mention Alerts**: Track when your site is mentioned elsewhere

## Implementation Notes

### Privacy First
- Always hash sensitive data (IPs, user agents)
- Make analytics opt-out easy
- Be transparent about what you track
- Follow GDPR/privacy best practices

### Performance Considerations
- Use beacon API for non-blocking requests
- Batch analytics events
- Implement client-side buffering
- Consider edge workers for processing

### Visualization Ideas
- Real-time visitor map
- Interactive flow diagrams
- Heatmaps for click/scroll behavior
- Time-series graphs for trends

### Fun Touches
- "Currently X visitors from Y countries"
- "Most popular time to visit: 2 AM ðŸ¦‰"
- "You're visitor #1234 today!"
- Easter eggs for specific behaviors
